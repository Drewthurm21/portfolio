				<h4>~Learning to code has provided me the most interesting and engaging learning experiences of my adult
					life.~</h4>
				<br>
				<p> Through the process of learning two separate tech stacks (JS/Express/Sequelize &
					Python/Flask/SQLAlchemy) I have been able to solidify my foundational knowledge of backend web
					architecture and RESTful APIs. Using both Pug and Jinja2 as templating engines as well as React &
					Redux has provided me an opportunity to work with some of the most
					popular technologies in the industry.</p>
				<p>
					After learning the core concepts and design patterns of two very different tech stacks I
					feel far more prepared to enter the workforce, acclimate and contribute to any team quickly. </p>
				<br>

				<br>
				<p>For the first full-stack project at App Academy we would build a clone of <a href='https://www.goodreads.com'
						target='_blank'>goodreads.com</a> functionality but employ our
					own style. We were given Friday and the weekend to plan, and the following Monday-Friday to code. We
					would be using JavaSript, Express / Sequelize
					and Pug. </p>
				<p>Coding a full-stack website from scratch was an incredible learning experience! I the opportunity
					to conceptualize and implement a relational database, simple server
					architecture, RESTful API and backend routes. I also got to work with Pug as a templating engine to
					serve
					data driven HTML to the client. Please feel free to take a look at <a
						href='https://goodgames-appacademy.herokuapp.com/' target='_blank'>GoodGames here</a>, and poke
					around as a demo
					user for
					added features.

				<h4>~The only way to do great work is to love what you do.~</h4>
				<br>
				<p>
					My journey into programming began two years ago. I always thought learning to code would be an
					interesting
					and rewarding challenge so I purchased an
					introductory course covering Java to try it out. I enjoyed working my way through the course but
					when work got busy my
					hobbies hit the back burner. </p>
				<p>A year later,
					during the downtime imposed by the Covid-19 shutdown,
					I dove in head first. I worked on App
					Academy's online program teaching Ruby and Ruby on Rails. I built simple apps like a console based
					hangman games & then quickly moved into OOP with a browser based
					tic-tac-toe game. They were simple apps, but they were interactive and fun. It was all very exciting
					and I quickly fell
					in love. </p>
				<p>Business management is a
					fun and challenging profession, and some of the lessons I learned in my leadership roles have been
					invaluable both in business and my personal life. But with ten years of experience in the rushes,
					derailments, trials and triumphs of the GM world I realized my passion for it was gone. I wasn't
					excited about it anymore. I realized it was time to move on.
				</p>
				<h4>
					~I began putting
					the pieces together to facilitate a career change.~
				</h4>
				<p>
				<p> Following talks with my boss I was tasked with training my replacement throughout the month of
					August, 2020. September first I would begin applying to bootcamps and within 1 month I would be
					accepted at HackReactor,
					FlatIron School and App Academy. I was left with a tough but promising decision to make.</p>
				<p>
					After careful consideration of the tech stacks these schools offered, I decided to attend <a
						href='https://appacademy.io' target='_blank'>App Academy</a>. A rigorous 1000-hour bootcamp with
					a ~3% acceptance rate and a solid industry reputation. 
					The course teaches full-stack web development. They employ a heavy focus on
					JavaScript/Express/Seqelize || Python/Flask/Flask Alchemy for backend &  HTML/CSS/React/Redux/ as well as Pug and Jinja2 for front end
					development and templating. I graduated June 4th 2021.</p>

					~Time to embark on a new journey.~
